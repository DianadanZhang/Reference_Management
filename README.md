# WEN FAN-PhD Reference Paper Management 

_**Keep updating.**_

<!-- TO DO:
- Add links
- Search for more papers
- Better categories, Better curation
- Add 2020/2021 works for skill assessment
- Elaborate on surgical phase/action recognition
- Elaborate on surgical instrument/scene segmentation
- last big 4
- two pie charts (venue / Topic) -->
